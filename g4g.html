                            <br>
							<p>As a Software Developer intern at CDK, I worked on 3 projects. The third and smallest one of the three, yet very fruitful, was my involvement in the "g4g project" where I teamed up with Samarth Goudar, Abhitej Arora, Sameer Joshi, Sathwik Nadella, and Saurabh Vijaywargia. In a competition of about 10 different teams of Software Development Intern groups, the objective was to produce some kind of application aimed at young girls, to encourage them to get involved in tech. My team and I had the idea of producing a mobile app, based on React Native, that could be run on iOS and Android. This app, would display 9 female Mathematicians and 9 female scientists (that are not mathematicians), and would show their greatest works and bio.</p>
							<p>We developed react components that were used 10 times on each category of females. Such component includes Bio such as name, years active, greatest works, youtube videos, and awards among other things, of these scientists and mathematicians. The above video shows one of the latest updates of how the app looked, as was recorded by a teammate. The only one other update not shown in that video, is that in the video there's 6 female mathematicians shown, but the final product had 9. The app also quizzes the girl participants to help them understand what kind of career paths they could potentially be interested in based their interests.</p>						
							<p>Out of about 10 teams, my team obtained the award of "Most Creative Impact", as shown on the following image:</p>
